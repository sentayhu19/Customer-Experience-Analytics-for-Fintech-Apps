"The previous version is much better than this one. I used it for more than six years without any problem. But now I'm having a serious trouble with the updated app. I don't know why it takes him forever to refresh and load the home page once you sign in. And if it fails to load, it never recovers. I only see some UI changes. Really disappointed",2,2021-01-01,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"The good thing is its simplicity to undertake the basic functions. Updates with improvements and fixes should have been released by now. Please fix. 5 years after last review… Issues with beneficiary are fixed. However, still unable to track transactions much less to download in appropriate formats. This feature got diminished in the latest update. Please improve and fix.",3,2023-03-15,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
The updated app is attractive and is working very well. Forced to revise my previous rating of 2 star to 4 star. Hope it will keep on working! Rated it excellent for the past years. Revised my review after it keeps on crashing in 2019 and installing it for a second time in less than 3 months. Please work on the problems.,4,2020-07-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"I love this app. It's simple to use and syncs fast. The only issue I had was the balance shows only what's on the ledger, there is no way to tell what the actual balance is. I learn about the difference between the two balance types the hard way on an ATM machine. I would love to see that fixed in your next update.",5,2021-09-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"It is a service that is not expected from such a large institution. I saw that your work is very complicated. The user does not understand well your application. In general, you have many problems. This application is not convenient for the end user. For instance I can't access my account from abroad what I depsited amount and transfer from my account to any any one .It is a shame.",1,2024-10-16,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.",2,2025-05-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"this new update(Mar 19,2025) is great in fixing bugs, stability and smooth experience I'll give u that but it came with a big shortcoming which is not allowing to take screenshot. I can't screenshot neither my balance nor the transaction or anything within the app, i understand it's for security reasons but please bring that back, allow us to take screenshot we need that. Thanks.",4,2025-03-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Good job to the CBE team on this mobile app! It's designed in a way that's simple and intuitive to navigate, which is great for everyone.

Thank you for this useful application.",5,2025-04-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,5,2025-05-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
as if the update of march 19 i can't take a screenshot in the app. i can just save it as file and that is so annoying. i used to save all screenshot in my gallery in one folder now with the extra steps added i have to save the file go to file and then screenshot it. the solution is to allow the screenshot to be save in to gallery automatically. i wish you give this review attention and resolve the issue shortly.,2,2025-03-19,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Old version was very friendly to use. Now we can't see the #Reason The #transaction history (very limited) and now it crash every time it's opened. More over, the last update prevents us from taking #screenshots. Thanks for the developers as they are getting more stupid than ever.",1,2025-03-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
Taking away the screenshot of the receipt is just silly. Worse is tbe download button putting a copy of the screenshot - which you prevented to be taken - in tbe downloads folder where we cant attach directly from Whatsapp. Millions of people use the screenshot as proof of payment / transfer yet you make that harder for everyone? I have every user contacts the developer or manager who made this awful decision.,1,2025-03-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Recently there is big problem when sending to safaricom, telebir, and even to cbebirr wallet could anybody who is responsible fix it, it's very frustrating it's been 5 days and my money hasn't been returned it takes it out of my account but doesn't send it to my mpesa update- they have just corrected it and sent me back the money but still I'm afraid now to send again",2,2025-05-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play

"I’ve been using the CBE mobile banking app, and overall, I appreciate its features. However, I’ve noticed that when I turn on the developer options on my device, the app stops functioning properly.

"In the previous, I gave 4 🌟 for this app based on my evaluation. This app was without biometric security and may be exposed to cheaters unexpectedly. It is solved now. You can add verification security on the setting app. But there is something problem still with verification. It must prevent logging in without correct input fingerprint.",5,2024-12-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play

"my first frequent experience of cbe app is critical-time failure such as suspending payment on air for 2-5 days with zero explanation, deducting from sender account without depositing to the receiver act. Another fatal error by the banking company as a whole (not the app itself though) is forced-banking with corporations without consent of employers-users of the corresponding corporations",2,2025-04-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play

"First this app was pretty good and well connection while transferring money, but now there's no such a worst mob app ever while transferring money it corrupts due to the network and took the amount of money you were transferring from your account then after seconds interruptions it's shows that the money is transferred (this case happens especially to telebirrr wallet) then after you report the issue to the CBE customer service they refund your money to your CBE account after 3-5 days.",2,2025-01-09,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
Two step verification update is fake (meaningless). Why because the app gives you an option of to use pin while requesting two step verification step. 🔐 This updated app is not differ than the previous one in case of security & safegaurding users.👹👹💀💀 The other features of the app are best and easy to use it.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,1,2025-03-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
What an absolutely terrible update. No screenshots and you still have this stupid restriction on developer options. WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF US WHO ARE ACTUALLY DEVELOPERS!!!!!! At this point telebirr just wins the game 100%. CBE. Do. Better!,1,2025-03-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
Really! this app is more simple to use at any time in every where also it's transaction quality between the users within the transaction receipt as abank that means this app is our bank on hand in mobile frankly I proud on this bank digital. I have no word to wrote ...... but it's have weakness on poor connection.,5,2025-03-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"The app is full of bugs here and there, perhaps it's from the backend side idk. For instance the transaction history you see on top is one made a couple of months ago and you have to refresh until you reach the top. it's just so bizarre. And you can't even search for a transaction you made. Someone with a lot of transactions will find it annoying. Even simple things like localising dates to Amharic dates are now correctly implemented.",2,2025-02-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
It made life alot easier. I cant even imagine having to make all those transactions in person. So this app was crucial for me. Very good app. well done.,5,2025-04-03,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
It used to be the best bank app in Ethiopia. But now using it is a terrible experience. For every transaction it shows an error message. Making a simple payment requires 5 to 6 trials to complete.,1,2025-01-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
I'm sad guys what are you doing? Why did you add the screenshot restriction to the app? You just made it worse it was a great value to us. You need to rethink it. i will change the 1 star rating when you resolve the issue.,1,2025-03-22,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
If any developer is reading this please fix the screenshot functionality or at least the download button should work flawlessly without me touching it twenty times.,1,2025-05-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
Its good but we need an option of choosing a specific period to get a historique of transactions. For example when i want to check my previous transactions i only get few transactions. Thank you.,2,2025-01-30,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
well designed! Fixing bugs & two step verification with biometric... simply it's great!,5,2025-05-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play

"As an app developer, I rely on Developer Mode to build and test apps, but this app blocks access entirely if it's enabled. This restriction is unnecessary and makes it impossible for developers to use the service. Instead of outright blocking, consider implementing enhanced security measures that don't alienate professionals who need this setting. Please reconsider this policy.",2,2024-12-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
it is good app. But you have integrate cbe with cbe birr. to allow cardless withdrawal directly from our accout!,4,2025-03-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
Doesn't work properly. It crashes some many times. commercial bank of Ethiopia not only the application but also sending money to own CBE birr doesn't get your money in your bank account. forcefully you must wait 3-5 days to get your money back to your account. walk up CBE the world is going to decentralized finance.,1,2025-03-26,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"I am not exaggerating when I say that this application is one of the biggest players in the banking industry. It has simplified a lot of things for the user, even if the bank is in his pocket. But my opinion is (1), when we transfer money, there is a word limit on the (Note) at the end. Why can't we write our reason briefly? I don't understand why it is limited. On the other hand, there is no limit on the bank. Could you explain this? (2), when we pay for water, why is the code not mentioned",5,2025-03-29,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"I have seen lots of great updates right here, especially the 2FA using the biometric security technique, I suggest you work on minimising app crashing due to the accumulation of cache, very little cache crash it.",4,2025-02-03,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Add customer service please other than calling 951. Why would you have a mobile app but not an online text-based customer service? Why? Disappointing And I will never use the top-up feature again, I have been trying to recharge my safaricom balance but your app would say time out and then credit my account but never recharge my balance, why? Where is my money? Do you expect me to call 951 at midnight?",2,2025-02-08,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Why on earth is CBE telling me to turn off developer mode? As the name clearly states, it's for developers, not for CBE to dictate. There are countless financial apps out there that work just fine without demanding such an unnecessary restriction. If your app can’t handle developer mode, that’s a you problem. Fix your code instead of disabling features that have absolutely nothing to do with you.",2,2025-01-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"I really like this app as it is being updated from time to time and includes multiple payment options. In particular, giving a receipt makes it even more preferable. However, when it is refreshed, it does not show the history of credit and deposit in order and, I am of the opinion that it is better if the recent history is fixed respectively according to the transaction date in the future because there is a problem of confusion.",3,2024-09-12,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"I like the application very much because it is user friendly and makes transactions easiest, especially for business matters. But, these few days I faced difficulties of opening it. I tried to uninstall and re install the app, and re verified at the nearest cbe center. But still failed to use all the functions. It says 'none available'. Any suggestions please!",3,2023-06-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Most of the time, in the 'Recents' button the app becomes stuck and doesn't show up details of transactions and doesn't even scroll down; should be solved. Second, the app doesn't save the last pop-up screen when a transaction is complete. Third, there is no telebirr transfer to other person option and the app by default lets you to only own telebirr transfer.",4,2022-10-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"It's a great app. I've been using this app since the bank launched it. As a long-term user, I would like to point out things that need to be improved. 1. Deleting money transfer history should be the user's choice. 2. There should be an option to download an in-depth transfer history for each transfer activity , just as there is posiblity to download a single time transfer recit. Do that and get 5 star.",3,2022-03-18,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"This app has several issues based on my experience. Below are the problems that I encountered: 1. The app frequently crashes. 2. It only shows a limited transaction record history (25 transactions). 3. You can't access the transaction records after 8:00 pm and on Sundays. 4. It displays a ""payment failed"" message. It would be greatly appreciated if you could address these issues",1,2024-08-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
1 star because I have to visit my bank for new installation of the app and reactivation takes about 45 to 60 minutes with there long queue and system failures. Learn from telebire app and give options to customers to apt out of this ridiculous security feature. Second why is there no customization in the settings for displaying which account I want displayed in the first section rather that slide to my main account every time. You are making us pay a monthly subscription. Bare minimum is not it,1,2025-02-26,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"My experience with this app has been outstanding so far,but sometimes it has a hard time connecting with network and makes it hard to make transactions. Apart from that it's amazing.",4,2024-12-17,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"I have been using this app for almost four years now. In the beginning, it was working fine. Sometime later, it gets difficult to create a connection to my account, and could not manage to make and see transactions on my account. After updating it lately, Jul 2020, I was glad this app came with some user interface improvements, and the connection was quite fast. Not longer than two weeks, the app starts to get stuck, and it cannot even show me the UI properly. As a result, I have a useless app on my cell phone, hoping that [you] will soon come with updates.",2,2020-09-03,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Application UI and new features are better than the previous version. I found a minor bugs though. I couldn't transfer to an account from the beneficiary list, it says None Available; There is still so much to do with the localization; Instead of ሰኔ it says ጁን and more like this; date conversion is missing also. If this minor things are fixed it will be much better.",3,2020-11-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"It is a good and progressive app through the updates. I think the app should further solve its bugs like 1. It doesn't download or share attachment on android 12 and 11, it used to work on android 10. 2. Sometimes transactions seem like they have failed and there are no records, but the transactions actually have passed this is a very serious issue, because people will try the transaction again which will end up doubling the payment.",4,2022-09-15,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"With each update the app is getting slower and slower, specially when requesting transaction history. And I wish the logging process could be done easily. When someone changes a phone, it makes it mandatory to consult the branch and that makes it not to be self assisted. Hope you could fix it. Please add an option of transferring to other TeleBirr numbers other than the ""Own telebirr"" option. It id very limiting now a days",4,2023-08-11,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Absolutely the best app! It works flawlessly, anytime and anywhere.",5,2025-04-17,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"The CBE mobile banking app is a time-saver, but it needs several improvements, like adding fingerprint authentication. It's risky when people see me entering my PIN. Additionally, the fees are unreasonable. You could learn from Tele Birr, which adjusts fees based on the transaction amount. However, the CBEMB app charges a flat 10 birr fee for amounts between 5 and 1000 birr, which I think is unfair.",2,2024-09-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"The app is awesome. But there are many things to highlight.For example, When spending money from the account , a confirmation text message must be sent to the account holder. Also the fact that, the PIN is only four digits is not safe enough for security, if it is more than eight digits and includes numbers and symbols, it will be cool.",3,2023-01-29,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play
"Still needs development on several features.... For example - bank statements available online. The text feature of available balance and debited/credited notifications is very old school and involves too much digital trail. App doesn't always work, could be due to network issues in Ethiopia though. Another major issue is an error message is displayed when transferring from CBE to other banks. Ive almost lost a few thousands doing this once. Always cross check your balances.",1,2024-08-27,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play

"I really love this app,it is amazing. It is more flexible than any other banks app. The only and main problem that I encountered with this app is,if it is uninstalled from this devices, I have to go to the bank and mostly the specific barank the account is opened to reconfigur again.

Can you please just make it functional. I don't think anyone cares how good it looks if not a single functionality works. Plus it's not even aestheticaly nice. The loading animated icon has white irregular edges because the logo wasn't cut out correctly. The app doesn't work at all. It doesn't even login. It gets stuck on login just showing the logo animation and blames the issue on connectivity. Connectivity is fine and the proof is that this review is posted.,1,2024-04-15,Bank of Abyssinia,Google Play
"Developers/ the company takes too long to update the app, and throughout that process, the app is basically useless. We can't send money or even be able to check our account. They even take it down from the Play Store for a while. This whole process usually takes them 3 to 5 days. This is very disappointing. It is an improvement from the previous version of the app, but they still have a long way to go to compete with the likes of CBE. Transferring to other banks sometimes doesn't work.",2,2024-05-03,Bank of Abyssinia,Google Play

"Edit: New bug, app not letting me type in my otp codes. Shameful Why does this app not allow me to use it while having developer options on? Did y'all consider that I might, perhaps, be an actual developer? Why am I expected to toggle the option on and off just to bank (restarting my phone when I do)?
